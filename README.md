## Overview
This project performs multivariate statistical analysis and classification on Portuguese wine data.

The goal was to:
1. Classify red vs white wines
2. Predict highest-quality wines
3. Analyze multivariate differences across quality levels

## Methods Used
- Correlation analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Hotelling’s T² Test
- MANOVA
- ROC Curve / AUC Evaluation
- Train/Test Split

## Tools
- R
- tidyverse
- caret
- MASS
- pROC
- factoextra

## Key Results
- Strong separation between red and white wines in PCA space
- Logistic regression achieved high AUC for red vs white classification
- MANOVA indicated significant multivariate differences across quality groups
